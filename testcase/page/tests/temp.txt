Dear Ms. Smith,
     I'm Li Hua, Chair of the Student Union of Yucai Middle School, which is close to your university. I'm writing to invite you to be a judge at our English speech contest to be held in our school on June 15. It will start at 2:00 pm and last for about three hours. Ten students will deliver their speeches on the given topic ¨CMan and the Nature.  We hope that you will accept our invitation if it is convenient for you. Please call me at 44876655 if you have any questions.
     I am looking forward to your reply.
With best wishes,
Li Hua
